6) after you gho through all the cells gui will close, in the output folder you will find screenshot for every cell and most importantly csv files where every column is a calcium trace for a cell. You can use that for data visualization.
   neuro_corr_traces.csv has all the traces with the first column indicating frames
   neuro_corr_traces_labelled.csv has an extra 2 rows with area in pixel and imageJ ROI name for every cell.
   there are also matlab variables with a list of accepted ROI and rejected ROIs.
